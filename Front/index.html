          <h2>How to Use</h2>
          <p>
            This website relies on the convert shell command of the ImageMagick software to convert the uploaded file to a ppm so 
            any <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php">image format</a> it supports will work. However, the image returned is in the same format
            as the image uploaded, so it is possible that the browser will be unable to open the image.<br>
            The radius field in the form below is used to 
            determine the size of the shapes used to recreate the image. How the reconstruction is performed is by repeatedly randomly selecting a pixel as well as
            a value x in the range from 1 to radius inclusive and then constructing a 2x+1 px by 2x+1 px square around the chosen pixel within which
            the shape used to make up the image is constructed. A default radius, represented by the number 0 in the form, is used if no value is entered 
            into the radius field. <br>
            Below is a table of how default radiuses are calculated.
          </p>
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Operation</th>
                <th>Default Radius Formula</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Pointillism</td>
                <td>\(ceil(\frac{\sqrt{(min(width, height))}*5}{600})\)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Rectanglism</td>
                <td>\(ceil(\frac{\sqrt{(min(width, height))}*5}{600})\)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Hexagonlism</td>
                <td>\(ceil(\frac{\sqrt{(min(width, height))}*5}{525})\)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Trianglism</td>
                <td>\(ceil(\frac{\sqrt{(min(width, height))}*5}{400})\)</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            Additionally, you may not enter a radius such that this expression, 
            \(\frac{width*height}{4*radius^2} < 300 \), is true as the server will fail your request. Basically, don't make the radius too large. <br>
            Furthermore, the server will also fail requests involving images with more than \(2.4*10^7\) pixels.<br>
            Note: Larger images and larger radius values take exponentially longer to process.
